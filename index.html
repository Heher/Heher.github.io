		<h2>Innovation starts with ingredients</h2>
		<p>Lovely as a natural rose is, it takes around 60,000 of them and a near-endless supply of other resources to make a single ounce of rose oil. However, ingredients derived from organic chemistry use the same fragrant molecules as their inspiration, they just happen to be made by people. For all of our fragrances, we've made tough but important decisions when choosing between synthetic and natural ingredients. For instance, a natu-</p>

			<h2>SUSTAINABLE SYNTHETICS IN HANAMI</h2>
			<p>Natural Indian Sandalwood, prized for its distinctive scent, has been over-harvested to the point of near decimation. But all is not lost; labs have successfully created scent molecules that are indistinguishable from natural sandalwood. Better than that, they are safe for skin and the environment. We believe in preserving natural Sandalwood and proudly use this synthetic alternative in Hanami.</p>

			<h2>Supporting Tradition with Moab</h2>
			<p>Central American Snowbell trees (aka: Styrax trees) produce a resin essential to many fragrances, including Moab. However, its safe and sustainable method of harvest is becoming a lost art. In procuring this precious resin for our fragrance, we’ve chosen a supplier that helps preserve the craft by mandating competitive wages and more transparency throughout the supply chain.</p>

			<h2>STRENGTHENING COMMUNITIES WITH HEPCAT</h2>
			<p>The harvests of Madagascan farmers sustain entire communities but are subject to weather patterns and the limited growing season of their cash crop - vanilla. By introducing vetiver to these farmers, our partner Symrise created a new revenue stream to encourage economic growth and fortify the soil. Not only is this Madagascan vetiver in Hepcat, we are proudly the first brand in the world to use this responsible and revolutionary ingredient.</p>
